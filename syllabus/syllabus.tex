\section*{Course Overview}

MATH 369 is an introduction to the intermediate concepts of mathematical statistics, statistical inference and theory of experimentation.  Lectures and their topics with time estimates are below:

\input{_lecture_schedule}


\textbf{This is more of a typical mathematics theory course than the rest of the data science series but it is still not like the other math courses you're used to; it will be more philosophical and very high in conceptual density while the mathematics itself is kept deliberately simple.} But we will still attempt to keep our eye on developing ideas and concepts for helping to make decisions in the real world. Thus we may make limited use of computation using the \texttt{R} statistical language.

\subsection*{Prerequisites}

MATH 241 (basic probability), 201 (multivariable calculus) and 231 (linear algebra) or equivalents. I expect a 241 class that covers more or less what I cover in 241. See the course homepage for links under \qu{prerequisite review}. The multivariable calculus and linear algebra we will use I will try to review in class.

\section*{Course Materials}

\paragraph{Textbook:} I will be referencing Larry Wasserman's \emph{All of Statistics: A concise course in statistical inference} which can be purchased on \href{https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387402721}{Amazon} and Casella and Berger's \emph{Statistical Inference} which can be purchased on \href{https://www.amazon.com/dp/8131503941}{Amazon}. There is no excuse not to have these books. They are \textit{required}. However, I will not ususally be teaching \qu{from the book} --- most of the material in the class comes from the lecture notes. The textbooks are a way to get ``another take'' on the material and they will only cover about only half of the material done in class. For the other half, you will have to make use of other resources. I also recommend Rice's \emph{Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis}, 3rd edition which can be purchased on \href{https://www.amazon.com/dp/0534399428}{Amazon} as well but I will not reference it during class.

\paragraph{Computer Software:} During lectures, there will be demoes using \texttt{R} which is a free, open source statistical programming language and console. You can download it from: \url{http://cran.mirrors.hoobly.com/}. I do not expect you to do \textit{any} programming. If \texttt{R} will be part of the homework, I will give you the code to run and expect you to interpret the results based on concepts explained during the course.

\paragraph{Calculator:} You can use a TI-84, 85, 89 or any calculator which you wish. I strongly suggest you use \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{Wolfram Alpha} and its smartphone app.
