\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out.''  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read about two-sample hypothesis testing, creation of estimators via the method of moments, likelihood, log likelihood, the CRLB, Fisher Information and the score function.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems. \qu{[MA]} are for those registered for 621 and extra credit otherwise.

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 7 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. The easiest way to use overleaf is to copy the raw text from hwxx.tex and preamble.tex into two new overleaf tex files with the same name. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks which are \textit{not} on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records.

Identify who the two population groups. Run a test of significance to test if remission rates are unequal in the two groups.}\spc{5}



\end{enumerate}

\problem{We will review some Wald tests here.}


\begin{enumerate}


\intermediatesubproblem{[MA] For two independent samples of unknown DGP's with means $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ and unknown by finite variances, prove that the Wald test is an asymptotically valid 2-sample z-test.

To do this, you will need the following theorem. For constants $c, d$ and r.v. sequences $A_n$ and $B_n$ where $A_n \convp a$ and $B_n \convp b$ then $cA_n + dB_n \convp ca + db$. Then you use the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_mapping_theorem}{continuous mapping theorem} (what we've been calling Thm 5.5.4) and Slutsky's (i.e. follow HW4 1e exactly). Remember $S_1 \convp \sigma_1$ and $S_2 \convp \sigma_2$.}\spc{7}

\easysubproblem{For the obesity study, now consider the outcome metric \qu{binge episodes per week} which is a count metric (e.g. 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, ..., all 7 days!). Since it's real data, no moments are known! Explain why the normality assumption does not hold for the DGP in both samples.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{Test the theory that mean \qu{binge episodes per week} differs in both poputions. The raw data is in Table 3 and the format is $\xbar \pm s$. Don't forget that standard error is not standard deviation!}\spc{10}


\end{enumerate}

\problem{We will discuss theory of confidence intervals here.}

\easysubproblem{Provide the definition of an interval estimator and interval estimate.}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{What is the $\prob{\theta \in CI_{\theta, 1-\alpha}}$ if CI refers the interval estimat\inred{or?} Standard notation does not place a hat atop the \qu{CI}.}\spc{1}

\hardsubproblem{What is the $\prob{\theta \in CI_{\theta, 1-\alpha}}$ if CI refers the interval estimat\inred{e?} Standard notation does not place a double hat atop the \qu{CI}.}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{Let's say you run $L = 37$ experiments where you compute an exact $\doublehat{CI}_{\theta, 1-\alpha}$ in each one. What is the probability none of the confidence intervals contain $\theta$? This is essentially an easy Math 241 problem once you see what I'm asking.}\spc{2}

%\intermediatesubproblem{Find an approximate $CI_{\theta, 1-\alpha}$ by inverting the Wald test of 2(d). This means you must prove the approximate coverage is valid.}\spc{10}

\intermediatesubproblem{For the obesity study, consider the outcome metric \qu{binge episodes per week}, define $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ as the unknown populations' mean parameter and find an exact $\doublehat{CI}_{\theta_1 - \theta_2, 1-\alpha}$ assuming both population DGP's are normal and $\sigsq$ is the same in both populations.}\spc{3}

\end{enumerate}


\problem{We will talk a little statistical philosophy here.}


\begin{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}


\easysubproblem{State the univariate delta method. List assumptions.}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{Prove the univariate delta method. Justify each step.}\spc{5}

\hardsubproblem{Assume the $\iid$ Bernoulli DGP with mean $\theta$. Sometimes researchers are interested in a different parameterization, the log odds against the event ocurring, i.e. $\natlog{\frac{1-\theta}{\theta}}$, a metric that can be any number in $\reals$. Derive an asymptotically normal estimator for the log odds.}\spc{8}

\intermediatesubproblem{Given the previous answer, write a formula for $\doublehat{CI}_{\phi, 1-\alpha}$ where $\phi$ is the log odds against the event ocurring.}\spc{8}

\intermediatesubproblem{Recall the PUFA-Atrial Fibrilation after open heart surgery study from many of our lectures (click \href{https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/45/10/1723}{here} to find the study online). In class we derived a confidence interval for the odds against getting Atrial Fibrilation in the control group. Compute a $\doublehat{CI}_{\phi, 95\%}$ where $\phi$ is the log odds against getting Atrial Fibrilation in the control group and round to 3 digits.}\spc{3}


\easysubproblem{State the multivariate delta method. List assumptions.}\spc{3}

%\extracreditsubproblem{Prove the multivariate delta method. Justify each step.}\spc{12}


\hardsubproblem{Assume two independent populations both with $\iid$ DGP's with means $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ respectively and variances $\sigsq_1$ and $\sigsq_2$ respectively. Using the multivariate delta method, derive an asymptotically normal estimator for the ratio of the means $\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}$.}\spc{6}

\intermediatesubproblem{Given the previous answer, write a formula for $\doublehat{CI}_{\phi, 1-\alpha}$ where $\phi$ is the ratio of the means $\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}$.}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{For the obesity study, consider the outcome metric \qu{binge episodes per week}, define $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ as the unknown populations' mean parameter and find an approximate $\doublehat{CI}_{\phi, 1-\alpha}$ where $\phi$ is the ratio of the means $\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_2}$.}\spc{4}

\hardsubproblem{List all the reasons why the $\doublehat{CI}$ you constructed in the previous problem is approximate. How much should you trust it?}\spc{6}
\end{enumerate}


\problem{We will review (a) the equivalence of the two-sided $z$ test and the $\chi^2$ test and (b) the equivalence of the two-sided $t$ test and the $F$ test.}

\easysubproblem{Fill in the blank:

Note that $F_{\chisq{1}}(3.84) = 95\%$.}~\spc{3}

\end{enumerate}


\problem{This example is a famous one and you can find it on p161 of AoS. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel}{Gregor Mendel} was a scientist and abbott in what's now modern-day Czech Republic. In 1866 he published his work on a theory of genetic inheritance. He conjectured that if phenotypes, i.e. what you can see in an organism, were binary (e.g. ear lobe attached to your face or separated from the face) it was controlled by a pair of \qu{genes}. He proposed that the constituents of the pairs were either \qu{recessive} or \qu{dominant}. If one or both were dominant, the dominant phenotype would be expressed. If both were recessive, the recessive phenotype would be expressed. See \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel\#/media/File:Mendelian_inheritance.svg}{this illustration}.

In his famous pea experiment, he looked at two binary phenotypes of peas: shape (round vs. wrinkled) and color (yellow vs. green) which he assumed independent. He conjectured that the round was the dominant shape and yellow was the dominant color. He also conjectured that the initial expression of the genes were 50-50 dominant recessive. Thus, you would get 3/4 of the peas be round (dominant-dominant, dominant-recessive, recessive-dominant), 1/4 of the peas be wrinkled (recessive-recessive only), 3/4 of the peas be yellow (dominant-dominant, dominant-recessive, recessive-dominant) and 1/4 of the peas be green (recessive-recessive only). 

Putting it all together, 9/16 of all peas should be yellow and round, 3/16 should be yellow and wrinkled, 3/16 should be green and round and only 1/16 should be green and wrinkled. Between 1856 and 1863 he sampled $n = 556$ peas growing in his garden.}


\begin{enumerate}


\intermediatesubproblem{Formulate Mendel's conjecture as a null and alternative hypothesis. Construct your own notation.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Assuming the null hypothesis, what are the expected counts in each of the four groups for the $n = 556$ peas?}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Of the $n = 556$ peas, he found 315 were yellow and round, 101 were yellow and wrinkled, 108 were green and round and 32 were green and wrinkled. Calculate the value of the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test statistic to two digits which gauges the data's departure from $H_0$.}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{Run \qu{Pearson's $\chi^2$ goodness of fit test} at $\alpha = 5\%$ and state whether there is sufficient evidence to reject Mendel's theory of genetic inheritance. Note that $F_{\chisq{3}}(7.81) = 95\%$. Note: this is the wrong test; you should really be running a $\chi^2$ test of independence here which is way more powerful.}\spc{0.5}

\end{enumerate}


\problem{In class we spoke about the relationship between hair color and eye color for men. Here is an analogous dataset for women:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Brown & Blue & Hazel & Green \\ 
  \hline
Black & 36 & 9 & 5 & 2 \\ 
  Brown & 66 & 34 & 29 & 14 \\ 
  Red & 16 & 7 & 7 & 7 \\ 
  Blond & 4 & 64 & 5 & 8 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

}


\begin{enumerate}


\easysubproblem{Write the null hypothesis for hair and eye color being independent.}\spc{1}

\intermediatesubproblem{Under the null hypothesis, \emph{estimate} the expected frequencies in all 16 groups.}\spc{5}

\intermediatesubproblem{Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic which gauges the data's departure from $H_0$.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{Run a chi-squared test of hair and eye color being independent at $\alpha = 5\%$. Note that $F_{\chisq{9}}(16.92) = 95\%$.}\spc{0.5}


\hardsubproblem{[MA] There is also a \qu{chi-squared test of homogeneity}. Here we are testing the equality of proportion among many groups at once. If there was only one group, then you would use a two-proportion z-test. It turns out the test statistic is the same and it is asymptotically $\chi^2$ with degrees of freedom being the number of tests minus 1 (just like in the setting of the goodness of fit test). Here's frequency data on men and women's hair color:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
 & Brown & Blue & Hazel & Green \\ 
  \hline
Male & 98 & 101 & 47 & 33 \\ 
  Female & 122 & 114 & 46 & 31 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Write $H_0$ homogeneity between male and female across hair colors and $H_a$: heterogeneity between male and female across hair colors using this class's canonical notation. Then run the test.}\spc{15}
